# Mazing

## What is mazing?

Generating a maze using **[Recursive Backtracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_backtracker)** algorithm. Base on **[Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4)** challenge. ES6 and maze class with simple module wrapper for **[p5.js](https://p5js.org/)** library

Still work in progress

## How to run develop mode?

- clone repository
- get inside the folder
- run `npm install`
- wait a moment (enough to sip some coffee or down espresso or a shot)
- run `npm start`
- open `[http://localhost:900](http://localhost:900)`

## To Do list

- controls to define cell sizes and constraints
- better design
- some stats 
- whatever else I will fancy to add or what YOU will suggest! :)
